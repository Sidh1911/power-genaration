        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="p1">Oil, natural gas, coal, and other common energy sources are highly successful factors in economic advancement. However, with expanding energy consumption, lightning reduction of existing energy options, and environmental demands, renewable energy can pay off abundantly in terms of energy safety for countries throughout the world, mitigate greenhouse gas ejections, and assist us in addressing (possibly even preventing) global warming, which is one of the most challenging universal issues of the twenty-first century
In the late 1990 s, global consciousness of the diminution of usual energy supplies and the environmental consequences of the widespread use of fossil fuels rose substantially, supporting the evaluation of green energy assets 
            
            . Renewable energy sources include geothermal 
            , biomass 
        
            , ocean/marine 
            
            , hydroelectric/hydropower 
            
            
            
            , wind 
            
            
            
            , and solar 
            
            . </p><br>
            <div class="p1">Among all other renewable energy sources, ocean wave energy has the second-largest prospect 
            
                . The ocean is beyond 70 % surface of the earth, and water has an abundance of resources 
                
                . Furthermore, the ocean represents the world's largest unexplored source of energy. Wave energy has a far bigger power density than wind or solar energy. The amplitude and periodic feature of waves can vary relying on the sea surface, meteorological states, shore formation, and position on Earth. Waves have various features from day to night, day to day, season to season, and even hour to hour within the same day. As per design and implementation techniques, wave energy converters may provide electricity up to 90 % of the time, but wind and solar power systems only create 20–30 % of the time 
                
                . Hydropower, geothermal, biomass, wind, and solar are being utilized commercially in many sections of the world. Ocean energy, on the other hand, is far behind the other renewable energy sources in terms of commercialization, because the technology for exploiting ocean energy sources is still largely under advancement, and there are several roadblocks between the sector's existing state and the goal of commercialization. Another difficulty is that there is no grid infrastructure where the wave resources are located. Ocean power has a worldwide deployment capability of 337 GW, with above 885 TWh of electricity produced yearly 
        
                . </p><br>
                <div class="p1">Water wave energy, temperature gradient energy, salinity gradient energy, tidal energy, and ocean current energy are five distinct categories of ocean energy that have diverse roots and demand non-identical conversion technologies. Ocean wave energy, for example, means to the potential and kinetic energy emitted by ocean surface waves and has several benefits, such as a substantial power density, a diverse distribution, and, most significantly, a constant supply throughout the day and night, independent of the weather. Ocean wave energy throughout the world's shorelines is estimated to reach roughly 2–3 TW 
            
                    . Harvesting this energy needs only a tiny amount of land and poses few safety or security considerations 
                
                    . The planetary power of the wave is expected to increase by one order of magnitude if wave energy is harnessed in open seawater. As a result, energy from the wave is one of the most important fields for the expansion of ocean energy </div>

    <h1>Advantages of Wave Energy:</h1><br>
    <p class="p1">
        <li>Wave energy is renewable and virtually inexhaustible as long as oceans exist and winds create waves.</li>
        <br><li>Oceans cover over 70% of the Earth’s surface, offering a vast energy source. Certain coastal areas, especially where wave activity is high, hold significant untapped potential.</li>
        <br><li>Wave energy generation produces no direct greenhouse gases or pollutants, making it an environmentally friendly energy source.</li>
        <br><li>Ocean waves are more predictable than other renewable sources like wind or solar. It’s possible to forecast wave patterns, allowing better integration into energy grids.</li>
        <br><li>Unlike solar and wind, waves are continuous and less dependent on weather variations, potentially providing a more consistent energy supply.</li>
        <br><li>Development of wave energy can create jobs in coastal areas and stimulate local economies by requiring infrastructure, maintenance, and research.</li>

    <h1>Disadvantages of Wave Energy:</h1><br>
    <p class="p1">
        <li>Wave energy technologies are expensive to develop and install, especially at early stages. Infrastructure, maintenance, and operation can also be costly, making it less competitive with more mature energy sources like wind or solar.</li>
        <br><li>Wave energy technology is still in its infancy compared to other renewables, and there is no widely adopted standard. Devices must withstand harsh marine conditions, including storms and saltwater corrosion.</li>
        <br><li>Although it is cleaner than fossil fuels, wave energy infrastructure can affect marine ecosystems. Construction and operation may disrupt local habitats, affecting fish, marine mammals, and other wildlife.</li>
        <br><li>Wave energy installations could interfere with shipping routes, fishing areas, and recreational water activities. Balancing ocean energy use with other marine industries may be challenging.</li>
        <br><li>The effectiveness of wave energy depends heavily on the location. Coastal regions with high wave activity are ideal, but not every region has suitable conditions, limiting where this technology can be deployed efficiently.</li>
        <br><li>Most wave energy plants would be offshore, which presents difficulties in transmitting the generated electricity to land-based grids. The infrastructure required for energy transportation adds to the cost and complexity.</li>
